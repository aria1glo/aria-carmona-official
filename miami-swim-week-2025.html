    <h2>Aria Carmona Makes a Splash at Miami Swim Week 2025</h2>
    <p>Miami, FL — May 31, 2025 — Rising model Aria Carmona made waves at FUSION Swim Week Miami 2025, debuting in her first major runway show during Miami Swim Week. The high-energy event, held on May 31st and streamed globally on SHIFT via YouTube, spotlighted emerging designers and dynamic new modeling talent.</p>

    <p>The 21-year old walked for emerging label Frisk Me Good, known for its innovative approach to swimwear and statement pieces. Braving the rainy conditions, in a one-piece Frisk Me Good look, Aria brought energy and talent to the runway.</p>

As she transitions from regional events to larger fashion platforms, her newfound experiences in Miami signal that this is only the start of a blossoming career in the industry.</p>
